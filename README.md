# DNA_Search

In this repository we are interested in a particular DNA repository, commonly referred to as
16S. The Wikipedia article 16S ribosomal RNA describes some of the background
information. A collection of curated 16S DNA sequences from NCBI will be used in this
repository. The repository is concerned with managing access to the collection. The
biological science is out of context, but we are concerned with writing a C# program to
facilitate command line access to the data file. 

# To Run
Please download 16S.fasta file first link below
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9au0KUoBCoW7sWGR4xfVjugxJEn3BRA/view?usp=sharing

After that, Put 16S.fasta at Assignment2 -> bin -> Debug folder.
Also, put the file at INDEXING -> bin -> Debug folder.
